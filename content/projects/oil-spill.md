Oil spill is one of the major threats to marine ecosystems. It is caused by ship accidents, illegal ship discharge (bilge dumping) and natural oil seeps. An accurate monitoring and detection framework is necessary to classify the potential oil spills. Historically, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been used efficiently for classification of oil spills due to its operational capability in all-weather conditions. Oil spill appears as a dark stretch in SAR imagery. Similarly, low wind areas and algae blooms etc. have a similar dark signature, resulting in false positive detections. Research has been conducted on using deep learning techniques for classification of oil spills and look-alikes in SAR imagery, but still it remains a challenging task for researchers. This project is focused on using deep learning techniques and SAR imagery for classification of potential oil spills. We are investigating the deep learning based semantic segmentation of  SAR images for classification of oil spills from look-alikes. Additionally, we are considering detection of coastal areas and ships, because the dark stretch detected near a ship has a greater probability of being an oil spill due to bilge dumping or ship accident. Primarily, our focus is Pakistan territorial waters in the Arabian Sea. Due to lack of any operational framework, the oil spill events in Pakistan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) remain undetected until oil reaches the coastal regions. We are working on developing an operational framework to act to complement early warning systems.
