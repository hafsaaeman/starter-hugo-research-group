The rapid urbanization and industrialization is deteriorating air quality all around the world and winter SMOG causes severe problems especially in Asian countries. The environment protection agencies have installed air quality monitoring stations (AQMS) to measure the exposure level but increasing pollution demands to be monitored with high spatial and temporal resolution. It is a challenging task to install AQMS with very high spatial resolution especially for developing countries due to operating and installation cost. It is a burden on the federal/provincial exchequer. In this scenario any auxiliary sources of information on air
quality must be explored.

With this motivation, this project is focused on the use of remote sensing and ground stations data to develop a deep learning based framework that can predict the criteria air pollutants with high spatial and temporal resolution. This will increase the monitoring capacity without overburdening the government. Many atmosphere monitoring satellites are launched which have good spatial and temporal resolution. In this research work we will develop a model which will be implemented in different stages and estimate the surface concentrations with high spatial and temporal resolution by utilizing satellite data and ground stations data.
