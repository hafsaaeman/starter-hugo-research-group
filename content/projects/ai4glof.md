<!-- ## The project "AI for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods hazard potential assessment in Chitral, Pakistan” has been accepted by National Geographic & Microsoft under their "AI for Earth Innovation" program! :sparkles: -->

> **The project AI4GLOF is one of the 12 awards globally this year in National Geographic's "AI for Earth Innovation" program, and first-ever grant being awarded to any Pakistani research team since the inception of this program.**


### Summary
AI4GLOF will focus on the use of AI for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods hazard potential assessment in Chitral valley, Pakistan. The project aims at bringing in the much-needed tech-intervention to close the gaps between the effects of climate change on glaciers and their subsequent impact on the local communities residing downstream as well as the government’s policies and preparedness to respond in a timely and effective manner. The outcomes of this project will benefit all stakeholders, particularly the local communities, National and International NGOs and the disaster management authorities working in the glaciated regions of Pakistan. The project will provide an integrated analysis of the data from satellite imagery and ground-based weather stations to monitor the evolution of glaciers and assess the potential of hazards due to the formation, evolution and outburst glacial lakes. The project will build national capacity for long-term predictive analysis and early warning systems for disaster assessment & management that will provide critical technical advisory to the policy makers and sufficient time to the authorities to respond to any developing disaster in the glaciated regions of the country.
