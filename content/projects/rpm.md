*This project is closed. It originated at ComVis Lab set up by [Dr. Saquib Sarfraz](https://de.linkedin.com/in/saquib-sarfraz-6395783a) at COMSATS Institute of IT, Lahore. The project ran in collaboration with [Computer Vision & Remote Sensing Lab @TU-Berlin](https://www.cv.tu-berlin.de/menue/computer_vision_remote_sensing/parameter/en/), Germany.*

The project focused on the development of random point matching (RPM) as a general purpose technique in computer vision and pattern recognition, for matching of salient features/points across different imaging modalities.

RPM has been applied on two applications:

1. SAR-optical data fusion
2. Pairwise face matching

In both cases, RPM has yielded promising results. Please refer to the relevant publications.
